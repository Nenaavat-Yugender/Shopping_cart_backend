1. Compilation Command:
   # g++ cart_main.cpp -o main.exe
 This command compiles your C++ source code into an executable file.

 Explanation of Each Part:
  g++ → Calls the GNU C++ Compiler to compile the code.
  cart_main.cpp → Your C++ source file that contains the code.
  -o main.exe → Specifies the output filename for the compiled executable.
  -o stands for "output".
  main.exe is the name of the generated executable file (Windows uses .exe for executables).

2. Running the Executable:
   # ./main.exe

 This runs the compiled program.

 Explanation of Each Part:
  ./ → Tells the terminal to run cart_main.exe from the current directory.
  main.exe → The compiled executable file.
